<p>A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.</p>
<H3>FEEDING</H3>
<ul>
<li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
<li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
<li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
<li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
<li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GROOMING</h3>
<p>Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.</p>
<h3>EXERCISE</h3>
<p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.</p>
<h3>VACCINATION</h3>
<p>Vaccines help prevent many illnesses that affect pets. Vaccinating your pet has long been considered one of the easiest ways to help him live a long, healthy life. Not only are there different vaccines for different diseases, there are different types and combinations of vaccines. Vaccination is a procedure that has risks and benefits that must be weighed for every pet relative to his lifestyle and health. Your veterinarian can determine a vaccination regime that will provide the safest and best protection for your individual animal.</p>
<h3>SCOOP THE POOP</h3>
<p>Keep your dog on a leash when you are outside, unless you are in a secured, fenced-in area. If your dog defecates on a neighbor's lawn, the sidewalk or any other public place, please clean it up.</p>
